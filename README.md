**igblastr** is an R/Bioconductor package that provides functions to conveniently install and use a local IgBLAST installation from within R.

See https://bioconductor.org/packages/igblastr for more information including how to install the release version of the package (please refrain from installing directly from GitHub).

IgBLAST is described at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23671333/

Online IgBLAST: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/

## Quick start


### 1. Install and load igblastr

#### Install igblastr

First install and load **BiocManager**:
```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

library(BiocManager)
```

Loading **BiocManager** should display a message that indicates the
version of Bioconductor that you are using.

If you are using Bioconductor >= 3.22, simply install **igblastr** with:
```r
BiocManager::install("igblastr")
```
This will install the version of **igblastr** that matches your version
of Bioconductor.

If you are using Bioconductor 3.21, then you need to install directly
from GitHub (usually discouraged). That's because **igblastr** was only
added to Bioconductor >= 3.22 so cannot be installed from the Bioconductor
3.21 repositories:
```r
if (!require("remotes", quietly=TRUE))
    BiocManager::install("remotes")

BiocManager::install("HyrienLab/igblastr")
```

#### Load igblastr

```r
library(igblastr)
```


### 2. Set up IgBLAST

#### Install a pre-compiled IgBLAST

```r
install_igblast()
```

This will download the arch-specific pre-compiled IgBLAST from
https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/igblast/release/LATEST/
and install it in a persistent location. See `?install_igblast`.

#### or use an existing installation of IgBLAST

```r
Sys.setenv(IGBLAST_ROOT="path/to/igblast/root")
```

Note: Environment variable `IGBLAST_ROOT` should preferrably be set
in a more persistent manner outside R e.g. by defining it in the
user's `.profile` (on Unix/Mac). See `?IGBLAST_ROOT`.

#### Check IgBLAST

```r
igblast_info()
```

This will make sure that the installed IgBLAST is functional. It will
also display basic information about it (e.g. `igblastn` version).


### 3. Install germline dbs and select db to use

#### Install germline dbs

At least one germline db must be installed.

Several specialized functions will be provided for that e.g.:

```r
install_IMGT_germline_db()  # see '?install_IMGT_germline_db'
install_AIRR_germline_db()  # not ready yet!
# etc...
```

#### Select the germline db to use with igblastn()

```r
list_germline_dbs()
use_germline_db(<db-name>)
```

See `?use_germline_db`.


### 4. Select constant region db (optional)

The C-regions from IMGT are pre-installed for a few organisms:
```r
list_c_region_dbs()
```

Select the C-region db to use with `igblastn()`:
```r
use_c_region_db(<db-name>)
```

See `?use_c_region_db`.


### 5. Use igblastn()

See `?igblastn`.
